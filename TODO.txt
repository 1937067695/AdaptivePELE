* Move clustering/object.pkl to constants
* Move other constants (such in control file loading) to constants file
* I didnt use "__" for private methods, maybe use convention
* Don't redo clustering if it was done in the last iteration when using the "restart" option
* Add proper parametrization for clusterin method
