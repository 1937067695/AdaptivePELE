Behavior changes from previous version:
    *) Changed quadratic function for continuous
    *) Changed symmetry dictionary for list of dictionaries, with symmetry groups
    *) Added support for symmetry with contactMap
    *) Added lastSnapshot clustering for easy restart of sequential runs
    *) Added exitCondition on metric
    *) Added support for changing clustering when clustering method parameter changes, and be able to handle
    metric column change in spawning

Bug fixes:
    *) Fixed bug of incorrect atom consideration in symmetries
    *) Fixed bug of NaN correlation similarity evaluator in contactMap
