Behavior changes from previous version:
    *) Added scripts plot3DNetwork, plotSpawningClusters for better
    visualization of simulations
    *) Moved buildRevTransitionMatrixFunction to Cython code (speed-up of up to
    500x)
    *) Added exitContinuous density for exit path simulations

Bug fixes:
    *) Fixed minor bug in controlFileValidator
    *) Fixed bug in writePrecisePathToSnapshot, where backtracking was not
    carried out until the initial structure
