Behavior changes from previous version:
    *) Make code compatible with python2 and python3
    *) Add posibility of using a third column as color in plotAdaptive
    *) Change name of writePrecisePathToSnapshots to
    bactrackAdaptiveTrajectory, added name parameter to select the name of the
    output file and automatic detection of said name, so that if a file exists
    with the same name, a number is added at the end to differentiate them

Bug fixes:
    *) Fix bug in alternative structure when a cluster had no other structure
    than the representative
    *) Fix several bugs related to unicode and string handling
