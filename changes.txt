Behavior changes from previous version:
    *) Added script to reconstruct precise path to a given snapshot
    (writePrecisePathToSnapshot.py)
    *) Added possibility of chain and resnum selection in PDB
    
    *) Change names of clustering in control file 
    *) Added scripts to calculate free energies in pyemma_scripts
    *) Added new parameter to control the number of clusters considered in
    epsilon scoring
    *) Added script to build pdb files from extractedCoordinates files
    *) Added pathwayRMSD script
    *) Added default values for some params such as restart, debug, writeClusteringStructures,...
    *) Now we are able to read extracted traj with more than 3 coordinate (for multiple atom clustering)
    *) Now atom label changed in clusters.pdb, in order to ease cluster identification

Bug fixes:
    *) Minor bug fixes in scripts to calculate free energies
    *) Fixed bug of incorrect trajectory selection in estimateDG
    *) Fixed bug of multiple its plot not visible (bug due to pyemma)
    *) Fixed bug in symmetries. Now reading json as str not unicodes. It was not working since we used cython compiled files
