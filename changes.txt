Behavior changes from previous version:
    *) Alternative structures are stored in a priority queue with the priority
    set to the population of the subclusters spawn inversely proportinal way
    according to this population
    *) Added conformation network and first discovery tree to improve
    simulation analysis
    *) Added scripts to plot RMSF for each residue over a trajectory
    *) Added scripts to calculate contact map histogram for each residue over a
    trajectory or a complete simulation
    *) Added scripts to create a network of residues  over a trajectory or a 
    complete simulation
    *) Added more robust pickling interface so old simulation can be used with
    newer version (to some extent)
    *) Added script to reconstruct approximate path to a given snapshot
    (writeTrajToSnapshot.py)

Bug fixes:
    *) Fix bug in spawning of alternative structures, was not calling the new
    code for randomly spawn from cluster center of alternative structure
    *) Fix bug in pickling (serializing) coordinates of Atom objects
    *) Fix bug in pickling AltStructures objects
