Behavior changes from previous version:
    *) Alternative structures are stored in a priority queue with the priority
    set to the population of the subclusters spawn inversely proportinal way
    according to this population
    *) Added conformation network and first discovery tree to improve
    simulation analysis

Bug fixes:
    *) Fix bug in spawning of alternative structures, was not calling the new
    code for randomly spawn from cluster center of alternative structure
    *) Fix bug in pickling (serializing) coordinates of Atom
    objects
