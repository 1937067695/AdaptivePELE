Behavior changes from previous version:
    *) Added script to reconstruct precise path to a given snapshot
    (writePrecisePathToSnapshot.py)
    *) Added possibility of chain and resnum selection in PDB
    *) Change names of clustering in control file 
    *) Added scripts to calculate free energies in pyemma_scripts
    *) Added new parameter to control the number of clusters considered in
    epsilon scoring

Bug fixes:
    *) Minor bug fixes in scripts to calculate free energies
    *) Fixed bug of incorrect trajectory selection in estimateDG
    *) Fixed bug of multiple its plot not visible (bug due to pyemma)
